## Development
This website is built in React, and hosted on GCP. Commuters Sans is the only font in use, self served. Hosting is on GCP using App Engine, simply to test using that platform.

## Goals of the project
**Learn React.** I've been learning React for a few years now, so wanted to test my knowledge on a personal website. What's more, it's been a good few years since I've built a proper website from scratch, so I wanted to keep my web development skills up-to-date with new technologies/techniques.

**Use it as a playground.**. As I have new ideas and new features I want to experiment with, I will demo them on this website. The website will never be fully finished, I plan to keep building upon it.

**Have fun.** The main goal here was a fun graphic design and development project, rather than a serious personal website.

**Single page.** I didn't want to complicate the navigation, at least at this stage, where the content is light.

## Setup
To run this on your local machine, just run 'npm i', then 'npm start'. To build, run 'npm run build'
